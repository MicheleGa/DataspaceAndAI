  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as most of the keys in the first JSON are present also in the second one, even if with different values. However, the second JSON contains several additional keys like 'vital_signs', 'icd_diagnosis', 'anesthesia', 'surgery', 'body_mass_index', 'department', and 'in_hospital_death' that are not present in the first JSON. This significantly increases the structural complexity of the second JSON. The first JSON has a simpler structure with fewer nested blocks. Overall, while the core patient information is consistent, the harmonization process introduced substantial additional data in the second JSON, indicating an expansion of the data model rather than a simple alignment."
