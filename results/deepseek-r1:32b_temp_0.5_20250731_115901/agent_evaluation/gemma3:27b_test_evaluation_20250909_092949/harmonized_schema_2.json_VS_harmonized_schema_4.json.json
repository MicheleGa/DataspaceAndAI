  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity, as most of the keys in the first JSON are present and have the same meaning in the second one. However, the second JSON includes additional keys related to vital signs, ICD diagnosis, anesthesia, surgery, body mass index, department and in-hospital death, increasing the number of keys and nesting levels. This results in a low structural similarity. Overall, the harmonization process is partially successful, as the core patient data is consistent, but the addition of new information in the second JSON indicates an expansion of the data model."
