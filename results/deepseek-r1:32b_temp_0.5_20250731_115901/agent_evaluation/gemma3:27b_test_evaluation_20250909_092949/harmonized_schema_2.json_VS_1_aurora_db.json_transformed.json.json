  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as most of the keys in the first JSON have a corresponding key with a similar meaning in the second JSON. However, the second JSON introduces several new keys related to vital signs, ICD diagnosis, anesthesia, surgery, body mass index, department, and in-hospital death, which are not present in the first JSON. This significantly increases the number of keys and nesting levels in the second JSON, resulting in low structural similarity. The harmonization process appears partially successful in that core patient data is present in both, but the addition of new data points in the second JSON indicates an expansion of the data model rather than a strict harmonization."
