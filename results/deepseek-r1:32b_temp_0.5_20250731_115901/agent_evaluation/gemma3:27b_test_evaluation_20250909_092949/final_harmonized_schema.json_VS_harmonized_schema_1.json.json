  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity, as the keys present in the second JSON are a subset of those in the first. All keys in the second JSON are semantically equivalent to keys in the first. However, the structural similarity is low because the first JSON contains several keys and nested blocks (admission, discharge_location, insurance, emergency_department, vital_signs, icd_diagnosis, anesthesia, surgery, body_mass_index, department, in_hospital_death) that are absent in the second JSON. This suggests that the second JSON represents a simplified or partial view of the patient data. Overall, while the core semantic meaning is preserved, the harmonization process resulted in a loss of information and a significant structural difference."
