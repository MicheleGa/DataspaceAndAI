  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity since the keys of the first JSON correspond to those of the second one, even if the values are different datatypes. The structural similarity is also high, as both JSONs have the same keys and nesting levels. The second JSON is a simplified version of the first, primarily defining the datatypes of the values. Overall, the harmonization process was successful, as the core structure and meaning of the data are preserved."
