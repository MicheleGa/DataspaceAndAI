  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity since the keys of the first JSON correspond to those of the second one, with the exception of a few keys present in the first JSON that are absent in the second one ('anesthesia', 'surgery', 'body_mass_index', 'department', 'in_hospital_death'). The two JSONs also have high structural similarity, as they share the same nesting levels and the same organization of keys and nested blocks. Overall, the harmonization process was mostly successful, with only a few keys missing in the second JSON."
