  "verdict": "The two JSONs have medium semantic similarity. While both contain 'patient_identifier', 'gender', 'vital_signs', 'icd_diagnosis', and 'emergency_department', the specific keys within those blocks and the overall structure differ significantly. The second JSON includes many keys related to medical history, social determinants of health, and admission/discharge details that are absent in the first. The first JSON focuses more on immediate vital signs and a specific diagnosis, while the second provides a broader patient profile. The structural similarity is low because the nesting levels and number of keys per level are quite different. The harmonization process is not fully successful because the second JSON contains a lot of information that is not present in the first one, and vice versa."
