  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as the keys in the first JSON largely correspond to those in the second, even though the second JSON includes additional details. Both JSONs represent patient medical information. However, the structural similarity is low because the second JSON has significantly more keys and deeper nesting levels (e.g., 'vital_signs', 'icd_diagnosis', 'anesthesia', 'surgery') compared to the first. The second JSON provides more granular data, particularly regarding procedures and measurements, which are absent in the first. Overall, the harmonization process appears to have expanded the data model, successfully incorporating more detailed information, but at the cost of structural similarity."
