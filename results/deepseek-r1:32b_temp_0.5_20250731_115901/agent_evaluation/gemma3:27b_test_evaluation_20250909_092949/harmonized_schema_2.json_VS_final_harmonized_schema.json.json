  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as most of the keys in the first JSON are present in the second one with the same meaning. However, the second JSON introduces several new keys related to vital signs, ICD diagnosis, anesthesia, surgery, body mass index, department and in-hospital death which are not present in the first JSON. Structurally, the two JSONs are different because the second JSON has a greater number of keys and nesting levels. Overall, the harmonization process is partially successful, as the core patient information is consistent, but the addition of new keys in the second JSON indicates an expansion of the data model."
