  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as the keys present in the first JSON are largely present in the second one, with the same meaning. However, the second JSON is missing some keys present in the first one, such as 'body_mass_index' within 'physical_characteristics', and 'surgical_procedure', 'anesthesia', 'department' and 'death_in_hosp'. This leads to a low structural similarity, as the first JSON has more keys and deeper nesting at the root level. Overall, the harmonization process is partially successful, but requires the inclusion of the missing keys to be fully complete."
