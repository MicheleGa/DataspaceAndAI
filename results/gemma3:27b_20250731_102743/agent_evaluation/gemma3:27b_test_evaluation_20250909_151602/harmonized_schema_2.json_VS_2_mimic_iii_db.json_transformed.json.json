  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity. Most of the keys in the first JSON have corresponding keys in the second JSON, representing similar concepts (e.g., 'patient_id', 'age', 'gender', 'cardiovascular_conditions', 'admission', 'discharge_location', 'insurance', 'language', 'religion', 'marital_status', 'ethnicity', 'emergency_department', 'diagnosis'). However, the second JSON contains additional keys ('vital_signs', 'icd', 'surgical_procedure', 'anesthesia', 'department', 'death_in_hosp') that are not present in the first JSON. The structural similarity is low due to the additional nested blocks and keys present in the second JSON. The harmonization process was partially successful, as core patient data is present in both JSONs, but the second JSON includes more detailed information not found in the first, indicating an extension of the data model rather than a strict harmonization."
