  "verdict": "The two JSONs exhibit high structural and semantic similarity. They share the same keys and nested structure at every level. The values differ (e.g., specific measurements for height, weight, anesthesia details, department), but the meaning of the keys remains consistent across both JSONs. The harmonization process was successful, as the core data elements are represented in both messages, and the structure is preserved."
