  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity since the keys of the first JSON correspond to those of the second one. Both JSONs share the same nesting structure and key names at every level. While the first JSON defines the data types (INTEGER, FLOAT, STRING) and the second provides sample values or 'n/a', the core meaning of the data remains consistent. The structural similarity is also high, as the nesting and key organization are identical. Overall, the harmonization process was successful, demonstrating a strong alignment in data representation."
