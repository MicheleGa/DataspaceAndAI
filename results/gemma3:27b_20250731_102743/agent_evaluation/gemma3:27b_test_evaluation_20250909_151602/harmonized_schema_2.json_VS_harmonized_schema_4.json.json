  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as most of the keys in the first JSON correspond to those in the second one. However, the second JSON includes additional keys such as 'vital_signs', 'icd', 'surgical_procedure', 'anesthesia', 'department', and 'death_in_hosp' which are not present in the first JSON. Additionally, the second JSON includes 'body_mass_index' inside 'physical_characteristics' which is not present in the first one. This indicates a difference in the scope of information captured. Structurally, the two JSONs have different number of keys at the root level and different levels of nesting due to the added keys in the second JSON. Overall, the harmonization process appears successful in capturing the core information, but it is not complete due to the additional fields in the second JSON."
