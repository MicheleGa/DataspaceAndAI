  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as the keys in the first JSON generally correspond to those in the second, even though the second JSON provides specific values instead of data types. However, the structural similarity is low. The second JSON has significantly more keys at the root level and within nested blocks (e.g., 'vital_signs', 'icd', 'surgical_procedure', 'anesthesia', 'department', 'death_in_hosp') that are not present in the first JSON. The harmonization process appears to have expanded the dataset with additional information, but it has also changed the structure. While the core patient information is preserved, the addition of many new keys indicates a substantial change in the schema. Therefore, while the harmonization process hasn't lost information, it is not a simple mapping and represents a significant schema evolution."
