  "semantic_similarity": "High",
  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as the keys present in the second JSON are a subset of those in the first JSON, and they represent the same concepts. However, the structural similarity is low because the first JSON contains many more keys and nested blocks at various levels (e.g., 'admission', 'discharge_location', 'insurance', 'emergency_department', 'diagnosis', 'vital_signs', 'icd', 'surgical_procedure', 'anesthesia', 'department', 'death_in_hosp') which are absent in the second JSON. This suggests that the harmonization process may have involved a significant reduction in the scope of data captured, potentially leading to data loss. Although the core concepts are preserved, the absence of certain details in the second JSON could limit its utility."
