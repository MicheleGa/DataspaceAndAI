  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high structural and semantic similarity. They share the same keys at every level of nesting, indicating a very strong correlation in the data they represent. The second JSON extends the first one by adding 'vital_signs' and 'icd' keys, but this is an addition, not a change to existing keys. Therefore, the harmonization process appears to be successful with the addition of new information."
