  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity, as most of the keys present in the first JSON are also present in the second JSON with the same meaning. However, the second JSON is missing some keys present in the first one, such as 'body_mass_index' within 'physical_characteristics', 'surgical_procedure', 'anesthesia', 'department', and 'death_in_hosp'. This leads to a low structural similarity, as the first JSON is more comprehensive. Overall, the harmonization process is partially successful, as the core information is preserved, but some details are lost."
