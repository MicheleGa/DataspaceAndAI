  "semantic_similarity": "High",
  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as the keys in both JSONs represent the same concepts, even if the values have different types (e.g., STRING vs. FLOAT, INTEGER vs. 'n/a'). The structure is also very similar, with the same nested blocks and keys at each level. The harmonization process was successful, as the core data elements are present in both JSONs, although the value types differ, which might need further consideration depending on the downstream application."
