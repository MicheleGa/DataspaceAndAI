  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as the keys in the second JSON are present in the first one, even if with different data types. However, the structural similarity is low because the second JSON is a simplified version of the first, missing many keys and nested blocks. The harmonization process appears to be a simplification or data type normalization rather than a full data integration, which could be acceptable depending on the use case. The absence of several keys in the second JSON indicates that information is being discarded."
