  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity as the keys present in the second JSON are a subset of those present in the first one, and their meaning is consistent. However, the structural similarity is low because the first JSON contains many more keys and nested blocks at various levels (e.g., 'admission', 'discharge_location', 'insurance', 'emergency_department', 'vital_signs', 'icd', 'surgical_procedure', 'anesthesia', 'department', 'death_in_hosp') that are absent in the second JSON. The harmonization process seems to be incomplete, as the second JSON lacks several data points available in the first one."
