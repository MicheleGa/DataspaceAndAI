  "verdict": "The two JSONs have high semantic similarity because the keys in the first JSON largely correspond to those in the second JSON, representing similar concepts (e.g., 'patient_id', 'age', 'physical_characteristics', 'gender', 'cardiovascular_conditions'). However, the second JSON is significantly less detailed and omits many keys present in the first JSON, such as admission details, discharge location, insurance, language, religion, marital status, ethnicity, emergency department information, diagnosis, vital signs, ICD codes, surgical procedures, anesthesia details, department, and death information. The structural similarity is low because the first JSON is much more deeply nested and contains many more keys and nested blocks at each level than the second JSON.  While the core concepts are present in both, the lack of detail in the second JSON indicates an incomplete harmonization."
