  "verdict": "The two JSONs have low semantic similarity. While both contain patient-related data, the keys represent entirely different aspects of a patient's condition. The first JSON focuses on cardiovascular history and risk factors, while the second focuses on vital signs and diagnoses. There's no overlap in meaning between the keys. Structurally, the JSONs are similar in that they both have a root level with several keys. However, the nested structures differ significantly. Overall, the harmonization process was not successful because the data represented by these JSONs is not semantically aligned."
